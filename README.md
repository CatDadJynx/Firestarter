# Firestarter
Game loosely based on @marcello3D 's version here: https://github.com/marcello3d/firestarter which in turn is loosely based off of the fictitious game featured in the anime Fooly Cooly (FLCL). Most code contributed by @Pharap, helping to add/explain features beyond my (beginner) scope of knowledge
